# KnockoutCity SDK

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/knockoutcity-sdk.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knockoutcity-sdk)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/knockoutcity-sdk.svg)](https://github.com/tandashi/KnockoutCity-SDK/blob/main/LICENSE)

A developer friendly **unofficial** SDK for the private server build of [KnockoutCity](https://www.knockoutcity.com/private-server-edition).

> **Note**  
> This project is currently in alpha and is undergoing heavy development.

## Features

- Authenticate with a private server (with some [limitations](#limitations))
- Listening to various Server Events (e.g. group joins, invites, ...)
- Sending various Commands to the Server (e.g. group invites, match making, ...)

## Limitations

- Authentication is currently only possible to private servers. For authentication proxy servers (e.g. [KOCity-Proxy](https://github.com/Ipmake/KOCity-Proxy)) you can use the [KnockoutCity Auth Client](https://github.com/Tandashi/KnockoutCity-Auth-Client) to get the credentials.
- Joining Gameserver is currently not possible but will hopefully become a feature when the `VNET0` Protocol has been reverse engineered.

  // ...
});
